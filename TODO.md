## Current Progress Tracking
### Structure Progress
- Top-Level Folders: 12/12 ✓
- Top-Level READMEs: 12/12 ✓
- Root README: 1/1 ✓
- Intermediate Folders: 114/~500 (in progress)
- Intermediate READMEs: 15/~500
- Domain TODO.md files: 3/~100
- Article specifications: ~200/~3000 (in Science & Tech TODOs)

### Updated Strategy
**BREADTH-FIRST APPROACH**: Focus on complete structure and roadmapping
- Claude Opus: Creates folders, READMEs, and TODO specifications
- Future Process: Efficient creation of actual leaf articles based on roadmap

## Notes
- Each README.md should explain why this categorization makes sense
- Leaf documents should be concise but comprehensive (500-1500 words typical)
- Focus on human-centric explanations and applications
- Maintain consistent formatting and style across all documents
- Update this TODO.md as structure evolves and improves
