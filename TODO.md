## Notes
- Each README.md should explain why this categorization makes sense
- Leaf documents should be concise but comprehensive (500-1500 words typical)
- Focus on human-centric explanations and applications
- Maintain consistent formatting and style across all documents
- Update this TODO.md as structure evolves and improves
