## Phase 3: Intermediate README Completion ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Systematically identify placeholder READMEs** ✅ All 214 folders identified
- [x] **Fill intermediate READMEs** ✅ All READMEs now comprehensive following patterns:
  - Why this categorization exists and makes sense
  - Core concepts and major subdomains 
  - Key articles planned for this section
  - Human relevance and connection points
  - Cross-references to related domains
  - **Progress: 214/214 comprehensive READMEs completed (100.0%)**
- [x] **Prioritize by domain importance** ✅ Completed all domains systematically
- [x] **Maintain breadth-first approach** ✅ Complete structure foundation achieved

## Phase 3b: Depth and Granularity Assessment  
- [ ] Review each intermediate folder for necessary depth (2-4 levels typical)
- [ ] Identify cross-cutting themes that need representation in multiple areas
- [ ] Create symlinks or reference documents for interconnected topics
- [ ] Ensure balanced coverage across all domains

## Phase 3.5: TODO.md Format Refactoring ✅ COMPLETE

**Problem**: Current TODO.md files use inconsistent formats that make systematic article identification difficult. Need standardized, makefile-readable format for efficient Phase 4 development.

**Status**: All 12 domain TODO.md files successfully refactored to standardized format

### **New Standardized Format Requirements:**

```markdown
# Domain - Article Roadmap

## PRIORITY_HIGH
### Section_Name
- [ ] **Article_Name.md** | folder/path/here | Brief description here
- [x] **Completed_Article.md** | some/path | This one is done

## PRIORITY_MEDIUM
### Section_Name
- [ ] **Medium_Article.md** | path | Description

## PRIORITY_LOW  
### Section_Name
- [ ] **Low_Priority.md** | path | Description

## REFACTOR_STATUS
- [x] TODO_REFACTOR_COMPLETE
```

### **Format Rules:**
1. **Priority Sections**: `## PRIORITY_HIGH`, `## PRIORITY_MEDIUM`, `## PRIORITY_LOW`
2. **Article Format**: `- [ ] **Filename.md** | folder/path | Description`  
3. **Completion Tracking**: `- [x]` for completed articles
4. **Path Format**: Relative to domain root (e.g., `Physics/Classical_Mechanics`)
5. **Refactor Status**: `## REFACTOR_STATUS` with completion tracking

### **Refactoring Process:**
- [x] **Systematic Refactoring**: Use `make todo-refactor` to identify files needing updates
- [x] **Domain by Domain**: Refactor each domain TODO.md to match new format
- [x] **Article Extraction**: Convert current priority sections to standardized format
- [x] **Path Mapping**: Add proper folder paths for each article
- [x] **Completion Tracking**: Mark refactor complete in each file
- [x] **Validation**: Ensure `make todo-refactor` shows 0 files needing work

### **Benefits of New Format:**
- **Makefile Compatible**: Easy parsing for priority-based commands
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear completion status for each article
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent parsing on Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- **Systematic**: Enables proper `make priority-high`, `make priority-medium` commands
- **Scalable**: Format supports 1,100+ articles across all domains

**Target**: Complete refactoring enables accurate Phase 4 article identification and priority-based development workflow.

## Phase 4: Leaf Document Creation 🚀 READY - Phase 3.5 Complete

**Foundation Status**: Complete structural framework with 214 comprehensive READMEs and 1,100+ article specifications provides clear roadmap for efficient article development.

### **Systematic Article Identification System**

**Unified Article Todo System for Phase 4:**
- `make article-todo` - **NEW**: Unified system with priority filtering and completion tracking
- `make article-todo priority=high` - Shows all 782 HIGH priority articles (default)
- `make article-todo priority=medium` - Shows all 476 MEDIUM priority articles  
- `make article-todo priority=low` - Shows all 102 LOW priority articles
- `make article-todo priority=all` - Shows breakdown across all priorities with completion status
- `make next-articles` - Suggests next 24 articles (2 per domain) for balanced coverage
- `make todo` - Shows 207 leaf folders needing articles (structural view)

**Article Priority Levels:**
- **782 HIGH priority articles** - Core foundational concepts (start here)
- **476 MEDIUM priority articles** - Important domain expansions  
- **102 LOW priority articles** - Specialized and niche topics
- **1,360 total articles planned** across all 12 domains

### **Phase 4 Development Workflow**

**Step 1: Identify Next Articles**
```bash
make article-todo                    # See all 782 high-priority articles with completion status
make next-articles                   # Get balanced selection of 24 articles across domains  
make article-todo priority=all       # See breakdown across all priorities
make article-todo show_completed=false # Hide completed, show only remaining work
```

**Step 2: Select and Create**
- Choose article from priority list using unified `make article-todo` system
- Check domain TODO.md for detailed specifications  
- Create article in appropriate leaf folder following specifications
- Follow established README patterns and tone

**Step 3: Mark Complete and Track Progress**
```bash
# Mark article complete by changing [ ] to [x] in domain TODO.md
vim Science_and_Mathematics/TODO.md  # Change: - [ ] **Article.md** to - [x] **Article.md**

# Track overall progress
make status                          # Check overall completion statistics
make article-todo show_completed=false # See remaining high-priority items only
make article-todo priority=all        # See completion breakdown across all priorities
```
