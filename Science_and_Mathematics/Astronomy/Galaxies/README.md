# Galaxies

## Overview
Galaxies represent the fundamental building blocks of cosmic structureâ€”vast gravitationally bound collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter that serve as the universe's cities of light. From spiral arms tracing stellar nurseries to elliptical giants housing ancient stellar populations, galaxies reveal how matter organized itself into increasingly complex structures over cosmic time. Understanding galaxies means understanding how the universe transformed from smooth primordial gas into the rich tapestry of cosmic architecture we observe today.

## Why This Category Exists
Galaxy studies occupy a central position in astronomy because they bridge stellar physics and cosmology, revealing both the detailed processes of star formation and the large-scale structure of the universe. Galaxies serve as laboratories for testing theories of dark matter, stellar evolution, and cosmic evolution while providing the context for understanding our own Milky Way's place in the cosmos. Through galaxy studies, we trace the universe's history from early dark ages through the current epoch of accelerating expansion.
