This cosmic perspective fosters humility about our place while inspiring awe at our ability to understand the universe through science.

Every atom in our bodies was forged in stellar cores or in the first moments after the Big Bang—we are literally made of star stuff. Astronomy reveals both our cosmic insignificance and our extraordinary significance as the universe becoming conscious of itself. Through astronomical discovery, the cosmos studies itself through human curiosity and ingenuity.
