## The Cosmic Census
Exoplanet research reveals that planets are common throughout the galaxy, with most stars hosting planetary systems that differ dramatically from our own Solar System. This cosmic census shows that nature creates planets in configurations we never imagined—from scorching hot Jupiters to frozen super-Earths to mini-Neptunes that have no Solar System analog. The diversity of exoplanets suggests that our Solar System may be unusual rather than typical, fundamentally changing how we think about planetary formation and the likelihood of life elsewhere.

As we discover thousands more exoplanets and develop techniques for analyzing their atmospheres, we move closer to answering whether Earth-like worlds with signatures of life exist around nearby stars. The search for exoplanets represents humanity's first systematic attempt to place ourselves in cosmic context, potentially discovering that we live in a universe teeming with life or confirming that Earth's biosphere is rare and precious beyond measure.
