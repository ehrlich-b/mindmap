# Solar System

## Overview
The Solar System represents humanity's cosmic neighborhoodâ€”a gravitationally bound collection of the Sun, eight planets, their moons, and countless smaller objects formed from a primordial disk of gas and dust 4.6 billion years ago. This is our laboratory for understanding planetary formation, evolution, and the conditions that led to life on Earth. By studying our Solar System's diverse worlds, we learn about planetary science, astrobiology, and the processes that shape rocky and gaseous worlds throughout the universe.

## Why This Category Exists
Solar System astronomy deserves focused attention because it bridges theoretical astrophysics with direct exploration through robotic missions and telescopic observations. Unlike distant stars and galaxies, we can send spacecraft to study these worlds in detail, drill their surfaces, analyze their atmospheres, and search for signs of life. Understanding our Solar System provides the baseline for interpreting observations of exoplanets around other stars and helps us understand Earth's place in the cosmos.
