# Cosmology

## Overview
Cosmology represents humanity's most ambitious intellectual endeavor—understanding the origin, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe itself. From the primordial Big Bang through the formation of first stars and galaxies to the current epoch of accelerating expansion, cosmology weaves together observations of the most distant galaxies with theories of fundamental physics to reveal the universe's biography. This field addresses the deepest questions about existence: How did everything begin? What is the universe made of? Where is it all heading?

## Why This Category Exists
Cosmology deserves focused attention because it provides the ultimate context for all other sciences, revealing the stage upon which physics, chemistry, biology, and human civilization play out. The field drives revolutionary discoveries about dark matter, dark energy, and the fundamental nature of space and time while testing our most advanced theories of gravity, particle physics, and quantum mechanics. Cosmological research also reveals our cosmic origins—how the elements in our bodies were forged in stars and how the structures we observe today emerged from nearly uniform primordial conditions.

## The Ultimate Context
Cosmology provides the ultimate framework for understanding our place in existence—revealing that we live in an expanding universe that began 13.8 billion years ago, is composed mostly of mysterious dark matter and dark energy, and will likely expand forever into a cold, dilute future. The atoms in our bodies were forged in stellar furnaces, the galaxies we observe formed from tiny quantum fluctuations during cosmic inflation, and the cosmic microwave background radiation bathing Earth originated when the universe first became transparent to light.

This cosmic perspective simultaneously humbles us with our tiny place in vast space and time while inspiring awe at our ability to understand the universe's origin and evolution through science. Cosmology represents the culmination of human curiosity about existence itself, providing a scientific creation story that connects quantum mechanics to galactic structure, particle physics to cosmic evolution, and theoretical predictions to precise observations of the most distant galaxies. In studying cosmology, we study the biography of everything—including ourselves.
