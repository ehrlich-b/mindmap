# Chemistry

## Overview
Chemistry is the science of matter and its transformations - studying atoms, molecules, and the reactions that convert substances into new forms. It bridges physics and biology, explaining how the fundamental building blocks of matter combine and interact to create the rich diversity of materials we encounter, from water and air to complex biological molecules and synthetic materials.

## Why This Category Exists
Chemistry deserves distinct categorization because it operates at the crucial interface between atomic physics and biological complexity. While physics studies fundamental forces and particles, and biology examines living systems, chemistry explains how atoms bond together to form molecules and how those molecules transform through chemical reactions - the foundation of all material processes in our universe.

## Core Principles
- **Atomic Theory**: All matter composed of discrete, indivisible particles
- **Chemical Bonding**: Atoms sharing or transferring electrons to form compounds
- **Chemical Reactions**: Rearrangement of atoms creating new substances
- **Conservation of Mass**: Matter neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions
- **Periodic Law**: Element properties recurring in predictable patterns
