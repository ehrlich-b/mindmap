# Science and Mathematics

## Overview
This domain encompasses humanity's systematic understanding of the natural world through observation, experimentation, and logical reasoning. It represents our quest to uncover fundamental laws governing reality, from subatomic particles to the cosmos itself.

## Why This Categorization Exists
Science and mathematics form the foundation of our technological civilization and our understanding of existence. They provide tools for prediction, problem-solving, and innovation that have transformed human life. This category unites the empirical study of nature with the abstract language that describes it.

## Core Themes
- **Empirical Investigation**: The scientific method as humanity's tool for understanding reality
- **Mathematical Abstraction**: Pure logic and patterns that transcend physical reality
- **Predictive Power**: Models that allow us to anticipate and control natural phenomena
- **Universal Laws**: Principles that apply everywhere in the observable universe
- **Quantification**: Measuring and describing the world in precise, reproducible terms

## Major Subdomains

### Pure Sciences
- **Physics**: The fundamental forces and particles that constitute reality
- **Chemistry**: The behavior of matter and its transformations
- **Biology**: Life in all its forms, from molecules to ecosystems
