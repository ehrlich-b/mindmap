# Number Theory

## Overview
Number theory is the study of integers and their properties—the branch of mathematics that explores the fundamental building blocks of arithmetic. Often called "the queen of mathematics," number theory investigates patterns, relationships, and mysteries within the whole numbers that have fascinated mathematicians for millennia. From ancient questions about prime numbers to modern applications in cryptography, number theory bridges pure mathematical beauty with practical technological applications.

## Why This Category Exists
Number theory occupies a special place in mathematics because it deals with the most basic mathematical objects—integers—yet reveals profound depths and unexpected connections. It asks seemingly simple questions that often require sophisticated techniques to answer. The field demonstrates how elementary concepts can lead to deep insights, making it both accessible to beginners and challenging for experts. Its recent applications to computer science and cryptography have transformed it from "pure" mathematics to essential technology.
