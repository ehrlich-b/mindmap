# Seismology

## Overview
Seismology is the scientific study of earthquakes and seismic waves that propagate through Earth's interior, revealing both the dynamic processes that cause ground shaking and the internal structure of our planet. This field combines physics, geology, and advanced mathematics to understand how and why earthquakes occur, how seismic energy travels through different materials, and what these waves can tell us about Earth's deep structure from crust to core. Seismology provides essential knowledge for earthquake hazard assessment, early warning systems, and fundamental insights into planetary dynamics.

## Why This Category Exists
Seismology deserves focused study because earthquakes represent one of the most destructive natural hazards affecting human civilization while providing unique windows into Earth's inaccessible interior. The field provides crucial knowledge for assessing seismic hazards, designing earthquake-resistant infrastructure, and understanding the plate tectonic processes that shape Earth's surface. Seismology also demonstrates how waves propagating through materials can reveal hidden structures, establishing principles used in medical imaging, materials testing, and resource exploration.
