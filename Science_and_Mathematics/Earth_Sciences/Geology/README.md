# Geology

## Overview
Geology is the science that explores Earth's structure, composition, and processes through deep time, revealing how our planet formed 4.6 billion years ago and continues to evolve through plate tectonics, erosion, volcanism, and the cycling of materials between Earth's interior and surface. This field bridges physics, chemistry, and biology to understand how rocks form and change, how continents drift and mountains rise, and how geological processes have shaped the conditions that support life. Geology provides the foundation for finding natural resources, understanding natural hazards, and interpreting Earth's environmental history.

## Why This Category Exists
Geology deserves focused study because understanding Earth's structure and processes is essential for human civilization's relationship with our planet. The field provides crucial knowledge for locating and extracting natural resources, predicting and mitigating geological hazards like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and understanding how environmental changes occur over geological timescales. Geology also reveals the dramatic history of our planet, showing how Earth's surface, atmosphere, and life have co-evolved through billions of years.

## Earth's Story in Stone
Geology reveals Earth as a dynamic planet where seemingly solid rock actually flows, moves, and transforms over millions of years. From the restless motion of tectonic plates that constantly reshapes continents and ocean basins to the patient work of water and ice that sculpts landscapes grain by grain, geological processes operate on scales vastly different from human experience yet profoundly affecting human civilization.

Understanding geology means learning to read the story written in Earth's rocks—a tale of ancient oceans and vanished mountain ranges, of climate changes and mass extinctions, of the gradual accumulation of the atmosphere and the evolution of life itself. This geological perspective reveals both the immense stability that has allowed life to flourish for billions of years and the ongoing changes that continue to shape our planet's surface and interior.
