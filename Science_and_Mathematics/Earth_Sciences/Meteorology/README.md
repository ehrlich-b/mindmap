# Meteorology

## Overview
Meteorology is the science of Earth's atmosphere and weather phenomena, exploring the complex physical processes that create everything from gentle breezes to devastating hurricanes, morning fog to severe thunderstorms. This field combines physics, chemistry, and fluid dynamics to understand how solar energy, water vapor, atmospheric pressure, and Earth's rotation interact to produce the ever-changing patterns of weather that affect every aspect of human life. Meteorology provides the scientific foundation for weather forecasting, climate understanding, and protecting society from atmospheric hazards.

## Why This Category Exists
Meteorology deserves focused study because weather profoundly impacts human activities, from agriculture and transportation to energy consumption and public safety.
