# Oceanography

## Overview
Oceanography explores Earth's vast ocean systems, covering over 70% of the planet's surface and containing 97% of its water, revealing how these immense bodies of water drive weather patterns, support diverse ecosystems, and regulate global climate. This interdisciplinary science combines physics, chemistry, biology, and geology to understand ocean currents, marine life, seafloor geology, and the complex interactions between oceans and atmosphere that shape our planet's habitability. Oceanography demonstrates how the oceans serve as Earth's primary climate regulator while supporting the largest and most diverse ecosystems on the planet.

## Why This Category Exists
Oceanography deserves focused study because the oceans fundamentally control Earth's climate, weather, and habitability while remaining largely unexplored despite their critical importance to human civilization. The field provides essential knowledge for understanding climate change, managing marine resources, predicting weather patterns, and exploring the potential for new medicines, materials, and energy sources from marine environments. Oceanography also reveals how human activities affect ocean systems and what consequences these changes might have for future generations.
