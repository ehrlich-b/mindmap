# Earth Sciences

## Overview
Earth Sciences encompass the study of our planet's systems - from the molten core beneath our feet to the atmosphere above our heads, from ancient rocks recording billions of years of history to today's weather patterns affecting daily life. These sciences reveal how physical, chemical, and biological processes shape the dynamic planet we call home.

## Why This Category Exists
Earth Sciences deserve distinct categorization because our planet operates as an integrated system where geology, atmosphere, oceans, and climate interact continuously. Understanding these connections is essential for addressing climate change, natural disasters, resource management, and environmental protection. Earth Sciences bridge pure physics and chemistry with practical applications that directly affect human survival and prosperity.
