# Quantum Mechanics Foundations

## Overview
The foundations of quantum mechanics explore the fundamental principles, mathematical formalism, and conceptual framework underlying our most successful theory of microscopic reality. This field examines the wave-particle duality, uncertainty principles, quantum superposition, and measurement processes that define quantum behavior, revealing how the atomic and subatomic world operates according to rules radically different from everyday experience. Understanding quantum foundations provides the essential knowledge for grasping all applications of quantum mechanics, from chemistry and materials science to quantum computing and fundamental physics.
