# Newtonian Mechanics

## Overview
Newtonian mechanics represents the foundation of classical physics and our everyday understanding of motion, providing the mathematical framework that describes how objects move under the influence of forces. Developed by Isaac Newton in the 17th century, this elegant system of physical laws governs everything from falling apples to planetary orbits, spacecraft trajectories to sports physics. Newtonian mechanics remains the cornerstone of engineering, the starting point for all physics education, and the framework that still describes most motion in the human-scale world with extraordinary accuracy.

## Why This Category Exists
Newtonian mechanics deserves focused study because it provides the conceptual and mathematical foundation for all subsequent physics while remaining the practical framework for most real-world motion. Every engineer, scientist, and informed citizen needs to understand these principles to make sense of motion, forces, and energy in daily life. The field also demonstrates how mathematical descriptions can capture the essence of natural phenomena, establishing the methodology that underlies all of physics and much of science itself.

## Core Concepts

## Newton's Laws of Motion

### First Law (Law of Inertia)
Objects at rest remain at rest, and objects in motion remain in uniform motion, unless acted upon by unbalanced forces
- **Inertia**: The tendency of matter to resist changes in motion
- **Reference Frames**: Understanding motion depends on the observer's perspective
- **Equilibrium**: When forces balance, acceleration is zero
- **Everyday Examples**: Car passengers thrown forward during braking, objects sliding on ice
- **Historical Impact**: Overturning Aristotelian ideas about natural motion

### Second Law (F = ma)
The acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass
- **Force-Acceleration Relationship**: More force produces more acceleration
- **Mass as Inertial Property**: Greater mass requires more force for same acceleration
- **Vector Nature**: Force and acceleration have both magnitude and direction
- **Units and Measurement**: Newtons, kilograms, and meters per second squared
- **Problem-Solving Framework**: The equation underlying most mechanics calculations

### Third Law (Action-Reaction)
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction
- **Force Pairs**: Forces always occur in interacting pairs
- **Contact Forces**: Pushing, pulling, friction, and normal forces
