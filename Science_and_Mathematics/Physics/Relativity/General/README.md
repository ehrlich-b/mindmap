# General Relativity

## Overview
General relativity represents Einstein's revolutionary theory of gravity, fundamentally redefining our understanding of space, time, matter, and energy by revealing that gravity is not a force but rather the curvature of spacetime itself. This elegant geometric theory explains phenomena from GPS satellite corrections to black hole physics, from the expansion of the universe to gravitational waves, demonstrating that massive objects warp the very fabric of reality around them. General relativity stands as humanity's most successful theory of gravity and one of the most profound insights into the nature of the cosmos.

## Why This Category Exists
General relativity deserves focused study because it revolutionized physics and cosmology while providing the theoretical framework for understanding extreme astrophysical phenomena impossible to comprehend through Newtonian gravity. The theory enables GPS navigation, explains cosmic expansion, predicts black holes, and recently enabled the direct detection of gravitational waves. Beyond practical applications, general relativity offers profound philosophical insights into the nature of space and time, demonstrating how geometry and physics intertwine in ways that challenge everyday intuition.
