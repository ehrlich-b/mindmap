# Cosmological Relativity

## Overview
Cosmological relativity applies Einstein's general relativity to the universe as a whole, providing the theoretical framework for understanding cosmic expansion, the Big Bang, dark energy, and the large-scale structure and evolution of the cosmos. This field reveals how spacetime itself expands, carrying galaxies apart, while demonstrating how matter and energy density determine whether the universe expands forever, recollapses, or reaches a steady state. Cosmological relativity provides the foundation for modern cosmology, explaining the observed universe and predicting its ultimate fate.

## Why This Category Exists
Cosmological relativity deserves focused attention because it provides the only consistent theoretical framework for understanding the universe's origin, evolution, and ultimate destiny. The field explains fundamental observations like cosmic expansion, the cosmic microwave background, and the abundance of light elements while making testable predictions about dark matter, dark energy, and cosmic structure formation. Cosmological relativity also addresses the deepest questions about existence: How did the universe begin? What is its fate? Are there other universes?
