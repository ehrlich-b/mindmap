# Physics

## Overview
Physics seeks to understand the fundamental rules governing reality—from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest cosmic structures. It asks: What is the universe made of, and how does it work?

## Why This Category Exists
Physics forms the bedrock of natural science. Its laws constrain everything else that happens in the universe. Every chemical reaction, biological process, and technological device ultimately obeys physical principles. Understanding physics means understanding the deepest patterns of existence.

## Core Concepts
- **Forces**: The four fundamental interactions shaping all phenomena
- **Energy**: The capacity to do work, neither created nor destroyed
- **Matter**: What things are made of, from quarks to molecules
- **Space-Time**: The stage on which everything happens
- **Fields**: Invisible influences permeating space

## Human Relevance
Physics enables every technology from wheels to computers. It explains why we don't fall through floors, how eyes detect light, why stars shine, and what limits the possible. It reveals our cosmic context and fundamental constraints.

## Key Questions Physics Addresses
- Why does anything exist rather than nothing?
- What are the fundamental constituents of reality?
- Can we have a "theory of everything"?
- What is time, and why does it flow forward?
- How did the universe begin and how will it end?
