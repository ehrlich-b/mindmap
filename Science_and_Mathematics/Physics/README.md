# Physics

## Overview
Physics seeks to understand the fundamental rules governing reality—from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest cosmic structures. It studies matter, energy, forces, and their interactions to uncover the mathematical laws that describe how the universe operates at its most basic level.

## Why This Category Exists
Physics forms the bedrock of natural science because it identifies the fundamental constraints that govern all phenomena. Every chemical reaction, biological process, and technological device ultimately obeys physical principles. Unlike other sciences that study specific systems, physics seeks universal laws that apply everywhere and always. Understanding physics means grasping the deepest patterns of existence.

## Core Principles
- **Conservation Laws**: Energy, momentum, and other quantities that remain constant
- **Symmetry**: How fundamental laws remain unchanged under transformations
- **Forces and Fields**: The four fundamental interactions shaping all phenomena
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Matter and energy exhibiting both wave and particle properties
- **Uncertainty and Probability**: Fundamental limits to knowledge and measurement
