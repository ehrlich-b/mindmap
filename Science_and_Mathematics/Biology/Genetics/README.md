# Genetics

## Overview
Genetics is the study of heredity—how traits are passed from parents to offspring through DNA, the molecular blueprint of life. This field bridges the molecular world of genes with the observable world of traits, revealing how information encoded in DNA creates the incredible diversity of living organisms while maintaining species continuity across generations. Genetics encompasses everything from basic inheritance patterns to cutting-edge gene editing technologies that promise to transform medicine and biotechnology.

## Why This Category Exists
Genetics deserves distinct categorization because it reveals the fundamental mechanism underlying biological diversity, evolution, and life itself. Unlike other biological sciences that study what organisms are or do, genetics studies how organisms become what they are through the expression of genetic information. Understanding genetics illuminates human origins, disease mechanisms, agricultural productivity, and biotechnology possibilities while raising profound ethical questions about manipulating the code of life.

## Core Concepts
- **DNA as Information**: Genetic code storing instructions for building and maintaining organisms
- **Gene Expression**: How genetic information becomes functional proteins and observable traits
- **Inheritance Patterns**: Rules governing how traits pass from parents to offspring
- **Genetic Variation**: Mutations, recombination, and other sources of diversity
- **Genotype vs. Phenotype**: The distinction between genetic code and observable characteristics

## Fundamental Principles

### The Central Dogma
The flow of genetic information in biological systems:
- **DNA → RNA → Protein**: Information flows from genes to functional molecules
- **Transcription**: DNA copied into messenger RNA (mRNA)
- **Translation**: mRNA instructions used to build proteins
- **Gene Regulation**: Complex control systems determining when and where genes are active
- **Exceptions**: Reverse transcription in viruses, non-coding RNAs with regulatory functions

### Mendelian Inheritance
Basic patterns of trait transmission discovered by Gregor Mendel:
- **Dominant and Recessive Alleles**: How different versions of genes interact
- **Segregation**: Each parent contributes one copy of each gene to offspring
- **Independent Assortment**: Different genes typically inherited independently
- **Punnett Squares**: Predicting offspring trait probabilities
- **Extensions**: Incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles
