# Anatomy

## Overview
Anatomy is the study of the structure and organization of living organisms—the detailed mapping of body parts, their spatial relationships, and how form relates to function. From the microscopic architecture of cells to the gross structure of organ systems, anatomy reveals how evolution has crafted bodies that are both engineering marvels and biological art. Understanding anatomy provides the foundation for medicine, biology, and appreciation of the intricate design underlying all life.

## Why This Category Exists
Anatomy deserves distinct categorization because structure determines function in all biological systems—you cannot understand how organisms work without knowing how they are built. Unlike physiology which studies processes, anatomy focuses on the physical architecture that makes those processes possible. Anatomical knowledge forms the essential foundation for medicine, veterinary science, biology, and any field requiring understanding of how living bodies are constructed and organized.
