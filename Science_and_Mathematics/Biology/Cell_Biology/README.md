# Cell Biology

## Overview
Cell biology is the study of cells—the fundamental units of life that form the basis of all living organisms. From single-celled bacteria to the trillions of specialized cells in the human body, cell biology explores how these microscopic structures carry out the processes of life: metabolism, growth, reproduction, response to environment, and death. Understanding cells reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying all biological phenomena and provides the foundation for medicine, biotechnology, and our comprehension of life itself.

## Why This Category Exists
Cell biology deserves central focus because cells represent the basic level where chemistry becomes biology—where non-living molecules organize into living systems. All biological processes, from photosynthesis to consciousness, ultimately occur at the cellular level. Cell biology bridges molecular biology and organismal biology, explaining how genetic information creates functional organisms and how life maintains itself through cellular processes. This knowledge drives medical advances, biotechnology applications, and fundamental understanding of what distinguishes living from non-living systems.
