# Biology

## Overview
Biology is the science of life - studying living organisms from the molecular level to entire ecosystems. It seeks to understand how life functions, evolves, and interacts across all levels of organization, from DNA molecules to global biomes. Biology uniquely bridges the physical sciences with the complexity of living systems.

## Why This Category Exists
Biology deserves distinct categorization because life exhibits properties not found in non-living systems: self-organization, reproduction, evolution, and consciousness. Unlike physics or chemistry studying fundamental forces, biology examines emergent complexity where simple rules create remarkably sophisticated behaviors and structures.

## Core Concepts
- **Life as Information**: DNA storing and expressing genetic instructions
- **Evolution**: Change over time through natural selection and genetic variation
- **Hierarchy of Organization**: From molecules to cells to organisms to ecosystems
- **Homeostasis**: Maintaining stable internal conditions despite environmental change
- **Energy and Metabolism**: Converting resources into growth, maintenance, and reproduction

## Key Articles to Create
Priority articles from [../TODO.md](../TODO.md#biology-articles):
- **What_Is_Life.md** - Defining characteristics distinguishing living from non-living
- **Evolution_Basics.md** - Natural selection, adaptation, common descent
- **DNA_and_Heredity.md** - Genetic code, inheritance, mutations

## Human Relevance
Biology directly applies to human health, food production, medicine, and environmental stewardship. Understanding our own biology helps manage health and disease. Ecological knowledge guides environmental protection. Agricultural biology feeds human populations. Medical biology develops treatments for disease and injury.

## The Living World
Biology reveals life as both mechanistic and mysterious - following physical laws yet creating complexity, beauty, and consciousness that transcends simple chemistry. Every organism represents billions of years of evolutionary refinement, carrying ancient molecular machinery while adapting to current environmental challenges.

From the elegant double helix of DNA to the vast migrations of whales, biology studies the most complex and fascinating phenomena in the universe: living systems that grow, reproduce, evolve, and in some cases, contemplate their own existence.
