# Ethics

## Overview
Ethics is the branch of philosophy that examines questions of right and wrong, good and bad, moral obligation and virtue. It seeks to understand what makes actions morally praiseworthy or blameworthy, what constitutes a good life, and how we should treat others. Ethics provides the philosophical foundation for moral decision-making in both personal life and social policy.

## Why This Category Exists
Ethics deserves distinct focus because moral questions permeate every aspect of human existence - from personal relationships to global politics, from technological development to environmental stewardship. Unlike descriptive sciences that tell us what is, ethics explores what ought to be. It provides systematic frameworks for evaluating actions, policies, and character traits, making it essential for navigating moral complexity in daily life and governance.

## Core Questions
- **What makes actions right or wrong?** Consequences, duties, motives, or character?
- **What constitutes a good life?** Pleasure, virtue, achievement, or relationships?
- **How should we treat others?** Equal consideration, care, respect for rights?
- **What do we owe future generations?** Environmental protection, sustainable development?
- **Are moral truths universal or relative?** Cultural variation vs universal principles
