# Eastern Philosophy

## Overview
Eastern philosophy encompasses the rich intellectual traditions of Asia, including Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian approaches to understanding reality, ethics, and human existence. Unlike Western philosophy's emphasis on analytical reasoning and systematic argumentation, Eastern philosophical traditions often integrate spiritual practice, holistic thinking, and experiential wisdom to address fundamental questions about life, suffering, enlightenment, and the nature of consciousness. These traditions have profoundly influenced billions of people and continue offering alternative perspectives on ethics, metaphysics, and human flourishing.

Eastern philosophy also provides perspectives on consciousness, meditation, non-duality, and spiritual development that have increasingly influenced Western psychology, neuroscience, and therapeutic practices while offering valuable insights for contemporary global challenges.
