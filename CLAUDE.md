# Mind Map Project - Knowledge Repository

## Project Overview
This repository represents a comprehensive, hierarchical map of human knowledge organized for exploration and learning. The structure mimics how knowledge domains naturally interconnect while maintaining clear categorical boundaries.

## Current Development Strategy
**BREADTH-FIRST APPROACH**: Creating comprehensive structure and roadmaps first, with leaf articles to be filled in later by efficient processes.

### What I (Claude Opus) Am Building
1. **Complete folder hierarchy** - All domains, subdomains, and topic folders
2. **Comprehensive README.md files** - Rich guides for every folder explaining structure and connections
3. **Detailed TODO.md roadmaps** - Distributed throughout the tree, mapping out exactly what articles should exist
4. **Article specifications** - Brief descriptions of what each leaf article should contain (in TODOs)

### What Will Be Built Later
- Actual leaf articles (500-1500 word explanations of specific topics)
- These will be created by more efficient processes based on the roadmap

## Structure Guidelines

### Folder Hierarchy
- **Top-Level Folders**: Major knowledge domains (e.g., Science_and_Mathematics, Human_Society_and_Culture)
- **Intermediate Folders**: Subdomains within each major area (e.g., Physics, Chemistry under Science)
- **Leaf Documents**: Specific topics as markdown files (e.g., `Quantum_Mechanics.md`, `Democracy.md`)

### Documentation Standards
1. **README.md Files**: Every folder must contain a README.md explaining:
   - Why this categorization exists
   - What topics it encompasses
   - How it relates to parent and sibling categories
   - Key concepts and themes
   - What articles should exist here (overview)

2. **TODO.md Files**: Distributed throughout subdirectories containing:
   - List of planned articles for that section
   - Brief description (1-2 sentences) of what each article should cover
   - Priority levels for article creation
   - Cross-references to related articles in other sections

3. **Future Leaf Documents**: Topic-specific markdown files will:
   - Be 500-1500 words typically
   - Focus on human-centric explanations
   - Include practical applications and examples
   - Reference related topics via links
   - Follow consistent formatting

### Content Philosophy
- **Human-Focused**: All content written from a human perspective, emphasizing relevance to daily life
- **Comprehensive**: Covering the breadth of human knowledge while maintaining appropriate depth
- **Interconnected**: Heavy use of cross-references to show relationships between topics
- **Accessible**: Clear explanations suitable for curious exploration
- **Evolving**: Regular updates as knowledge advances

## Navigation
- Start with [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the master development roadmap
- Browse top-level folders to explore major domains
- Use README files as guides through each knowledge area
- Check local TODO.md files for planned articles in each section
- Follow cross-references to discover connections

## Current Status ✅ FRAMEWORK COMPLETE
- Phase 1: Foundation structure planning ✅
- Phase 2: Complete folder hierarchy (207 folders) ✅
- Phase 3: Comprehensive READMEs for all top-level and sample intermediate folders ✅
- Phase 4: Complete TODO.md distribution with 1100+ article specifications ✅
- Phase 5: [Ready] Efficient creation of leaf articles using detailed roadmaps
- Phase 6: [Ready] Cross-referencing and refinement based on specifications

## Implementation Ready
The framework now provides:
- **Complete structural foundation** - All necessary folders and organization
- **Comprehensive roadmaps** - Detailed specifications for 1100+ articles across 12 domains  
- **Clear priorities** - High/Medium/Low priority guidance for systematic development
- **Cross-domain connections** - Mapped relationships between knowledge areas
- **Human-centric approach** - All content specified to emphasize relevance to human experience

## Contribution Guidelines
- Maintain consistent folder naming (Title_Case_With_Underscores)
- README files should be rich and comprehensive
- TODO files should clearly specify article requirements
- Preserve the human-centric perspective throughout
- Focus on structure and roadmapping over article writing
