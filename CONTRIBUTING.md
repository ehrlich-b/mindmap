# Contributing to Mind Map Knowledge Repository

## ðŸš¨ LLM-ONLY CONTRIBUTIONS POLICY

**IMPORTANT: This project requires ALL contributions to be generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Human-written content is explicitly NOT accepted.**

This policy ensures:
- Consistent voice and style across the entire knowledge base
- Scalable content creation that matches the project's architectural patterns
- Standardized quality and formatting
- Proper attribution and version tracking for AI-generated content

## Contribution Requirements

### 1. LLM Attribution (MANDATORY)

All commits MUST follow this exact format:

```
[LLM-MODEL] Brief description of change

Generated by [MODEL_NAME] version [VERSION] on [DATE]

Detailed explanation of what was changed and why.

Co-authored-by: [MODEL_NAME] <[model@provider.com]>
```

**Examples:**
```
[Claude-Opus-4] Add quantum computing fundamentals article

Generated by Claude Opus 4.1 on 2025-01-15

Added comprehensive overview of quantum computing principles to Technology_and_Computing/Emerging_Tech/Quantum_Computing/Fundamentals.md covering superposition, entanglement, and current applications.

Co-authored-by: Claude Opus <opus@anthropic.com>
```

```
[GPT-4] Enhance economics README with behavioral economics section

Generated by GPT-4 Turbo (2024-11-20) on 2025-01-15

Expanded Human_Society_and_Culture/Economics/README.md to include behavioral economics concepts, addressing gap in psychological aspects of economic decision-making.

Co-authored-by: GPT-4 <gpt4@openai.com>
```

### 2. LLM Model Requirements

**No specific model requirements** - contributions are judged on content quality, not the LLM used. This includes:
- **Commercial models**: Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.
- **Open source models**: Llama, Mistral, Qwen, etc.
- **Local models**: Any model you can run locally
- **Research models**: Experimental or specialized models

**Quality Standard**: We're typically looking for content quality equivalent to Claude Sonnet or better, but content will be evaluated on merit regardless of the model used. You can use your judgment to assess whether the output meets our standards - just don't write the content yourself.

**Note:** Model name and version must still be clearly specified in commits for proper attribution.

## Pull Request Requirements
