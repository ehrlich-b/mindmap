# Literature

## Overview
Literature is the art of written expression - using language to create works of beauty, meaning, and lasting cultural significance. It transforms human experience into narrative, poetry, and drama, preserving stories, exploring universal themes, and expanding empathy through the power of words. Literature serves both as entertainment and as humanity's collective memory and imagination.
