# Visual Arts

## Overview
Visual arts encompass humanity's expression through sight—the creation of images, forms, and spaces that communicate ideas, emotions, and experiences through visual perception. From prehistoric cave paintings to contemporary digital installations, visual arts represent our fundamental drive to make meaning visible, to transform raw materials into objects of beauty and significance, and to share inner visions through external forms.

## Why This Category Exists
Visual arts hold a unique place in human expression because they operate through the most dominant human sense—vision. Unlike music or literature, visual arts create objects that persist in space, allowing repeated contemplation and reinterpretation across time. They serve simultaneously as aesthetic objects, cultural documents, spiritual expressions, and social commentary, making them essential for understanding human creativity and cultural evolution.

## Core Concepts
- **Visual Perception**: How we see, interpret, and respond to images
- **Composition**: Organizing visual elements for maximum impact
- **Color and Form**: The building blocks of visual expression
- **Style and Movement**: Shared approaches across time and culture
- **Meaning and Interpretation**: How visual works communicate beyond words

## Major Mediums

### Painting
The application of pigments to surfaces for artistic expression
- **Oil Painting**: Rich, blendable medium enabling fine detail and subtle effects
- **Watercolor**: Transparent, flowing medium emphasizing spontaneity and light
- **Acrylic**: Versatile modern medium combining aspects of oil and watercolor
- **Fresco**: Painting on wet plaster, creating permanent wall decoration

### Drawing
Mark-making as fundamental visual expression
- **Pencil and Charcoal**: Gradations of tone, texture, and line quality
- **Ink Drawing**: Precise lines, bold contrasts, calligraphic expression
- **Digital Drawing**: Stylus and tablet enabling new possibilities
- **Mixed Media**: Combining multiple drawing materials and techniques

### Sculpture
Three-dimensional artistic expression in space
- **Traditional Sculpture**: Stone, wood, metal worked through carving and modeling
- **Modern Sculpture**: Abstract forms, found objects, conceptual works
- **Installation Sculpture**: Large-scale works transforming entire spaces
- **Digital Sculpture**: 3D printing and virtual forms

### Printmaking
Creating multiple artworks from original designs
- **Relief Printing**: Woodcuts, linocuts raising ink-bearing surfaces
- **Intaglio**: Etching, engraving using incised lines to hold ink
- **Lithography**: Chemical process using oil and water repulsion
- **Screen Printing**: Stencil-based method enabling bold graphics

### Photography
Capturing and manipulating light to create artistic images
- **Documentary Photography**: Recording reality with artistic vision
- **Portrait Photography**: Revealing character through careful composition
