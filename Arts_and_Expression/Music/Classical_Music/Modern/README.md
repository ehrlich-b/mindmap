# Modern Classical Music (20th-21st Century)

## Overview
Modern classical music encompasses the revolutionary transformations in Western art music from approximately 1900 to the present day, representing one of the most diverse and experimental periods in musical history. This era witnessed the complete dismantling of traditional harmonic, rhythmic, and formal conventions, giving rise to atonality, serialism, electronic music, minimalism, and countless other innovations that continue to challenge and expand our understanding of what music can be, directly influencing film scores, contemporary popular music, and digital art installations that shape modern cultural experience.
