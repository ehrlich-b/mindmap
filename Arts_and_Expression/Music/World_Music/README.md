# World Music

## Overview
World Music encompasses the diverse musical traditions, instruments, and styles that have evolved across cultures and continents. It represents humanity's global musical heritage - from African drumming and Indian ragas to Celtic ballads and Latin rhythms. This category celebrates musical diversity while recognizing the increasing interconnection and fusion of global musical traditions.

## Why This Category Exists
While Western classical and popular music dominate commercial markets, they represent only a fraction of humanity's musical creativity. World music preserves cultural identity, maintains traditional knowledge, and offers alternative ways of organizing sound and rhythm. Understanding global musical traditions reveals how different cultures express spirituality, celebrate community, and preserve history through organized sound.
