# Design

## Overview
Design represents the intentional shaping of objects, experiences, and environments to meet human needs while expressing aesthetic values and cultural meaning. More than decoration or styling, design is a problem-solving discipline that balances functionality, usability, aesthetics, and meaning to create solutions that enhance human life. From the everyday objects we use to the digital interfaces we navigate, design shapes our interactions with the material and virtual world while reflecting and influencing cultural values and social behavior.

## Why This Category Exists
Design deserves focused examination because it represents one of the most pervasive yet often invisible forces shaping daily experience, influencing everything from the ease of using a smartphone to the appeal of a product package. Unlike fine arts, design is inherently utilitarian, created to serve specific purposes while meeting aesthetic and cultural requirements. Understanding design illuminates how form and function interact, how visual communication works, and how thoughtful design can improve quality of life while reflecting human values and aspirations.
