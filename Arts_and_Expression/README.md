# Arts and Expression

## Overview
This domain encompasses humanity's creative outputâ€”the ways we express ideas, emotions, and experiences beyond purely functional communication. Art represents our drive to create beauty, meaning, and connection through aesthetic experience.

## Why This Categorization Exists
Art distinguishes human consciousness. While other species communicate and even create, humans uniquely produce works intended to evoke emotion, provoke thought, and transcend utility. This category captures the vast spectrum of human creativity from cave paintings to digital installations, from folk songs to symphonies.
