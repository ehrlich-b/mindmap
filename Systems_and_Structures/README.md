# Systems and Structures

## Overview
This domain examines the organized patterns and frameworks that underlie complex phenomena—from biological systems to social institutions, from supply chains to information networks. It focuses on how components interact to create emergent properties and behaviors.

## Why This Categorization Exists
Understanding systems is crucial for navigating complexity. This category captures the principles that govern everything from corporate hierarchies to ecosystems, from computer networks to economic markets. It provides tools for analyzing, designing, and optimizing the interconnected structures that shape our world.

## Core Themes
- **Emergence**: How simple rules create complex behaviors
- **Interdependence**: Components affecting each other
- **Feedback Loops**: Self-reinforcing and self-correcting mechanisms
- **Hierarchy and Networks**: Organizational patterns
- **Resilience and Fragility**: System stability and failure modes

## Major Subdomains
