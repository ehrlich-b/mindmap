# Natural World

## Overview
This domain encompasses Earth's living systems and physical environmentâ€”the biosphere we inhabit and depend upon. It represents nature as humans experience it: the landscapes we traverse, the creatures we share the planet with, and the ecological processes that sustain life.

## Why This Categorization Exists
While science studies nature systematically, this category captures nature as lived experience and ecological reality. It focuses on organisms in their environments, ecosystems as wholes, and humanity's complex relationship with the natural world. This is nature as home, resource, and inspiration.

## Core Themes
- **Biodiversity**: The stunning variety of life forms on Earth
- **Ecosystems**: Interconnected communities of living and non-living components
- **Natural Cycles**: Water, carbon, nutrients, and energy flows
- **Environmental Change**: Natural and human-induced transformations
- **Human-Nature Interface**: Our dependence on and impact on nature

## Major Subdomains

### Living World
- **Animals**: From microscopic to massive, terrestrial to marine
- **Plants**: Primary producers and landscape architects
- **Fungi**: Decomposers and symbiotic partners
- **Microorganisms**: The invisible majority of life

### Ecosystems and Biomes
- **Forests**: Tropical, temperate, and boreal woodlands
- **Oceans**: Marine environments covering 70% of Earth
- **Deserts**: Life in extreme aridity
- **Wetlands**: Transitions between aquatic and terrestrial
- **Grasslands**: Prairies, savannas, and steppes
- **Polar Regions**: Arctic and Antarctic extremes

### Earth Systems
- **Climate and Weather**: Atmospheric patterns and changes
- **Water Systems**: Rivers, lakes, groundwater, and ice
- **Geological Features**: Mountains, valleys, caves, and coasts
- **Soil**: The living skin of Earth

### Natural Resources
- **Renewable Resources**: Forests, fisheries, freshwater
- **Non-renewable Resources**: Minerals, fossil fuels
- **Ecosystem Services**: Pollination, water filtration, climate regulation
- **Energy Flows**: Solar, wind, geothermal, tidal

### Conservation and Environment
- **Biodiversity Loss**: Extinction and habitat destruction
- **Climate Change**: Anthropogenic warming and its impacts
- **Pollution**: Chemical, plastic, noise, and light
- **Conservation Strategies**: Protection, restoration, sustainable use

## Human Relevance
We are part of nature, not separate from it. Our food comes from ecosystems, our water from natural cycles, our oxygen from photosynthesis. Understanding the natural world helps us live sustainably, appreciate Earth's beauty, and recognize our role as both beneficiaries and stewards of the biosphere.

## Interconnections
- **Science_and_Mathematics**: Ecology, biology, and earth sciences
- **Health_and_Medicine**: Natural sources of medicine and health
- **Human_Society_and_Culture**: Environmental movements and nature-based cultures
- **Future_and_Speculation**: Environmental challenges and solutions

## Evolution of This Domain
From viewing nature as infinite resource to recognizing planetary boundaries, human understanding of the natural world has transformed dramatically. Climate change, mass extinction, and ecosystem degradation make this domain increasingly critical for human survival and ethical responsibility.
