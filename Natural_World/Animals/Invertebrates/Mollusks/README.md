# Mollusks

## Overview
Mollusks represent one of the most diverse and successful animal phyla on Earth, comprising over 100,000 known species ranging from tiny snails to giant squids. These soft-bodied invertebrates have adapted to virtually every environment on the planet, developing remarkable evolutionary innovations including shells, tentacles, jet propulsion, and complex nervous systems that showcase nature's ingenuity in solving survival challenges.

## Basic Mollusk Anatomy

### Fundamental Body Plan
Core structures shared across mollusk diversity:
- **Soft Body** - Unsegmented body lacking internal skeleton, protected by muscular walls
- **Mantle** - Tissue layer covering body organs and secreting protective shell material

### Specialized Structures
Distinctive mollusk features:
- **Shell Formation** - Calcium carbonate structures providing protection and support
- **Radula** - Rasping feeding organ with rows of tiny teeth for scraping food
- **Gills** - Respiratory structures often modified for feeding and sensory functions
- **Mantle Cavity** - Body space housing gills, organs, and waste elimination structures

### Organ Systems
Internal organization supporting mollusk life:
