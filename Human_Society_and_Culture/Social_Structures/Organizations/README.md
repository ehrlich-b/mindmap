# Organizations

## Overview
Organizations are purposeful social arrangements where people coordinate their efforts to achieve shared goals that would be impossible individually. They range from small nonprofits to multinational corporations, from voluntary associations to government agencies. Organizations are the primary way modern societies accomplish complex tasks requiring sustained collective effort.
