# Law and Justice

## Overview
Law and justice represent humanity's attempt to create ordered, fair societies through systems of rules, institutions, and procedures that govern behavior, resolve disputes, and protect rights. Law provides the framework of rights and obligations that shapes social interaction, while justice embodies the moral principles and ideals that law aspires to serve. Together, they form the foundation of civilized society, balancing individual freedom with collective order, power with accountability, and competing claims to fairness.

## Why This Category Exists
Law and justice deserve distinct categorization because they represent the fundamental mechanisms through which societies organize power, resolve conflicts, and pursue fairness. Unlike informal social norms, legal systems provide formal, institutionalized processes for making collective decisions, enforcing standards, and protecting individual rights. Understanding law and justice illuminates how societies balance competing values, address wrongdoing, and evolve their conception of fairness over time.
