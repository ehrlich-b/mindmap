# Financial Systems

## Overview
Financial systems are the networks of institutions, markets, and instruments that facilitate the flow of money and capital throughout an economy. They channel savings from individuals and institutions to businesses and governments that need funding, enabling investment, growth, and economic coordination across time and space. Modern economies depend entirely on sophisticated financial systems.

## Why This Category Exists
Financial systems are the circulatory system of modern economies - they determine who gets access to capital, at what cost, and under what conditions. Understanding finance illuminates how economic growth happens, why financial crises occur, how monetary policy works, and how individuals can build wealth. Financial literacy is essential for personal success and understanding economic policy debates.

- **Time Value of Money**: How money's worth changes over time due to interest and inflation
- **Liquidity**: How easily assets can be converted to cash
- **Leverage**: Using borrowed money to amplify investment returns (and risks)
