# Economics

## Overview
Economics studies how societies organize the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It examines human behavior around scarcity, choice, and resource allocation - fundamental challenges that shape every aspect of social organization from personal decisions to global trade.

## Why This Category Exists
Economic systems determine living standards, opportunity distribution, and power structures within societies. Understanding economics illuminates how markets work, why inequality persists, what drives prosperity, and how policies affect everyday life. It bridges individual choices with collective outcomes, making it essential for both personal financial decisions and civic participation.

## Core Concepts
- **Scarcity and Choice**: Limited resources requiring allocation decisions
- **Supply and Demand**: Market forces determining prices and quantities
- **Incentives**: How rewards and punishments shape behavior
- **Trade-offs**: Every choice involves costs and benefits
- **Market Efficiency**: How well markets allocate resources
