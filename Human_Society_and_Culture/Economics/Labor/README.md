# Labor Economics

## Overview
Labor economics examines how workers and employers interact in the marketplace, analyzing employment patterns, wage determination, skills development, and work conditions. It explores fundamental questions about how people choose careers, why wage differences exist, how technology affects jobs, and what policies can improve worker welfare while maintaining economic productivity.

## Why This Category Exists
Labor represents the most important economic resource for most peopleâ€”their ability to work and earn income. Understanding labor markets helps explain income inequality, unemployment patterns, career dynamics, and the evolving nature of work itself. As automation and globalization reshape employment, labor economics provides essential insights for workers, employers, and policymakers.

## Core Concepts
- **Labor Supply and Demand**: How many people want to work versus how many jobs are available
- **Human Capital**: Skills, education, and experience that increase worker productivity
- **Wage Determination**: Factors that influence how much different jobs pay
- **Labor Mobility**: Movement between jobs, industries, and geographic regions
- **Work-Life Balance**: Tradeoffs between earnings and leisure time
