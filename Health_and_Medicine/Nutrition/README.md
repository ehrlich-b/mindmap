# Nutrition

## Overview
Nutrition is the science of how food affects health, growth, and performance—the study of nutrients the body needs and how to obtain them through diet. It encompasses everything from basic biochemistry of vitamins and minerals to complex interactions between food choices and chronic disease risk. Nutrition bridges biology, chemistry, and behavioral science to understand how what we eat becomes who we are, physically and mentally.

## Why This Category Exists
Food is medicine, fuel, and pleasure combined. Nutrition deserves distinct categorization because dietary choices profoundly impact every aspect of health—from daily energy levels to lifelong disease risk. Unlike other health interventions, nutrition is something everyone engages with multiple times daily, yet nutritional literacy remains surprisingly low. Understanding nutrition empowers individuals to make informed food choices and recognize how diet affects both immediate wellbeing and long-term health outcomes.

## Core Concepts
- **Essential Nutrients**: Substances the body requires but cannot produce adequately
- **Energy Balance**: Calories consumed versus calories expended
- **Nutrient Density**: Nutritional value per calorie in different foods
- **Bioavailability**: How well the body can absorb and use nutrients
- **Individual Variation**: How genetics, age, and health status affect nutritional needs

## Essential Nutrients

### Macronutrients
The nutrients needed in large amounts for energy and structure
- **Carbohydrates**: Primary energy source, including sugars, starches, and fiber
- **Proteins**: Amino acids for building tissues, enzymes, and immune function
- **Fats**: Essential fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and concentrated energy
- **Water**: The most essential nutrient, comprising 50-70% of body weight

### Micronutrients
Vitamins and minerals needed in smaller amounts but essential for health
- **Vitamins**: Organic compounds supporting metabolism, immunity, and cellular function
- **Minerals**: Inorganic elements like calcium, iron, zinc supporting structure and function
- **Antioxidants**: Compounds protecting cells from oxidative damage
- **Phytochemicals**: Plant compounds with potential health benefits

### Fiber and Non-Nutritive Components
Important dietary components that aren't absorbed but affect health
- **Soluble Fiber**: Helps control blood sugar and cholesterol levels
- **Insoluble Fiber**: Promotes digestive health and regular elimination
- **Prebiotics**: Compounds that feed beneficial gut bacteria
- **Probiotics**: Living microorganisms supporting digestive and immune health

## Key Articles to Create

## Human Relevance
Nutrition affects every aspect of daily life: energy levels, mood, concentration, sleep quality, immune function, and long-term health. Poor nutrition contributes to leading causes of death including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, while good nutrition can prevent and sometimes reverse these conditions. Understanding nutrition enables informed food choices that support both immediate wellbeing and lifelong health.
