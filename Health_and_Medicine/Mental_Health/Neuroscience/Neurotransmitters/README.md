# Neurotransmitters

## Overview
Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that enable communication between neurons in the brain and nervous system, forming the molecular foundation of all mental processes, emotions, behaviors, and bodily functions. These specialized chemicals bridge the gaps between nerve cells, translating electrical signals into chemical signals and back again, creating the intricate communication networks that produce consciousness, memory, movement, and every aspect of human experience and functioning.

## Basic Neurotransmitter Function

### Synaptic Transmission
The process of chemical communication between neurons:
- **Action Potential** - Electrical signal traveling along nerve fiber triggering neurotransmitter release
- **Vesicle Release** - Membrane-bound packets containing neurotransmitters fusing with cell membrane
- **Synaptic Cleft** - Microscopic gap between neurons where chemical communication occurs
- **Receptor Binding** - Neurotransmitters attaching to specific proteins on receiving neuron
- **Signal Termination** - Breakdown or reuptake of neurotransmitters ending the signal

### Neurotransmitter Lifecycle
From synthesis to elimination:
- **Synthesis** - Production of neurotransmitters from precursor molecules within neurons
- **Storage** - Packaging in vesicles awaiting release signals
- **Release** - Calcium-triggered fusion of vesicles with presynaptic membrane
- **Receptor Activation** - Binding to postsynaptic receptors causing cellular responses
- **Inactivation** - Reuptake pumps or enzymes clearing neurotransmitters from synapses

### Types of Neurotransmitter Effects
Different ways neurotransmitters influence target cells:
