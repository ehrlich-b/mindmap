# Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

## Overview
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. Characterized by intrusive memories, avoidance behaviors, negative changes in thinking and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity, PTSD represents the mind's struggle to process and integrate overwhelming experiences.

Understanding PTSD is crucial for recognizing symptoms, providing appropriate support, reducing stigma, and accessing effective treatments. This knowledge helps communities create trauma-informed environments and support systems for those affected by traumatic experiences.
