# Treatment Approaches

## Overview
Mental health treatment approaches encompass the diverse evidence-based methods for addressing psychological distress, mental illness, and emotional challenges. These approaches range from psychotherapy and medication to lifestyle interventions and alternative therapies. Effective mental health treatment is individualized, often combining multiple approaches to address the whole person.
