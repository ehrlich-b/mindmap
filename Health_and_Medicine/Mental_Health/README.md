# Mental Health

## Overview
Mental health encompasses emotional, psychological, and social well-being - how we think, feel, and behave in daily life. It affects our ability to handle stress, relate to others, make decisions, and cope with life's challenges. Mental health exists on a continuum from flourishing psychological wellness to serious mental illness requiring professional treatment.

## Why This Category Exists
Mental health deserves distinct categorization because psychological well-being is fundamental to human functioning, yet often overlooked or stigmatized. Unlike physical health with visible symptoms, mental health involves complex internal experiences that significantly impact quality of life, relationships, and overall health. Understanding mental health reduces stigma and promotes early intervention and effective treatment.
