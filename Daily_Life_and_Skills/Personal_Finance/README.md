# Personal Finance

## Overview
Personal finance is the management of individual and household financial resources - earning, spending, saving, and investing money to achieve financial security and life goals. It encompasses the practical skills and knowledge needed to make informed financial decisions, build wealth over time, and protect against financial risks and uncertainties.

## Why This Category Exists
Personal finance deserves distinct categorization because financial literacy directly impacts quality of life, opportunity, and long-term security. Unlike macroeconomics or corporate finance, personal finance addresses the specific challenges individuals face: budgeting limited income, building emergency funds, saving for retirement, and making major purchases. These skills are essential for navigating modern economic life.

- **Time Value of Money**: Earlier investing creates more wealth through compound growth

- **Financial Goal Setting**: Clear objectives guiding financial decisions
