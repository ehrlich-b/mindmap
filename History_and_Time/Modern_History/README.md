# Modern History

## Overview
Modern history spans roughly from the Renaissance (15th century) through the early 20th century, representing humanity's transformation from medieval structures to the foundations of contemporary civilization. This period witnessed unprecedented changes in science, politics, economics, and social organization that fundamentally reshaped human society and laid the groundwork for our current world.

## Why This Category Exists  
Modern history deserves distinct categorization because it represents a fundamental break with medieval patterns and the emergence of recognizably modern institutions, ideas, and ways of life. Unlike ancient or medieval history, this period directly created many of the political, economic, and intellectual frameworks we still inhabit today. Understanding modern history explains how we arrived at current global systems.

## Core Transformations
- **Scientific Revolution**: Evidence-based understanding replacing religious authority
- **Political Revolution**: Democratic ideals challenging monarchical rule
- **Industrial Revolution**: Machine production transforming labor and society
