# History and Time

## Overview
This domain encompasses humanity's relationship with temporal progression—how we understand, record, and learn from the past while situating ourselves in the flow of time. It captures both the events that shaped our world and our methods for preserving and interpreting them.

## Why This Categorization Exists
History provides context for everything human. Without understanding where we came from, we cannot comprehend where we are or where we're going. This category explores not just what happened, but how we know what happened, why it matters, and what patterns emerge across time.

## Core Themes
- **Collective Memory**: How societies remember and forget
- **Causation and Change**: Why things happen and how they transform
- **Patterns and Cycles**: Recurring themes across time and culture
- **Historical Method**: How we reconstruct and interpret the past
- **Time Consciousness**: Human perception and measurement of time
