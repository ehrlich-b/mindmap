## What if an AI tried to map everything humans know?

Not like a dictionary. Not like Wikipedia. But like drawing a map of your hometown from memory - highlighting the paths you actually walk, the shortcuts you've discovered, the way neighborhoods connect in your mind.

This is **215 folders** organizing **1,100+ topics** into a living map of human knowledge, created by AI but designed for humans. It's less "here are facts" and more "here's how everything connects."

## Quick Start 🚀

Pick your adventure:

**🔬 Curious?** Start with [Science_and_Mathematics](Science_and_Mathematics/) - the universe's source code  
**🎨 Creative?** Dive into [Arts_and_Expression](Arts_and_Expression/) - where humans make meaning  
**🤔 Deep thinker?** Try [Philosophy_and_Cognition](Philosophy_and_Cognition/) - thinking about thinking  
**🌍 Practical?** Check [Daily_Life_and_Skills](Daily_Life_and_Skills/) - the stuff that actually matters day-to-day  

Or just browse around. That's kind of the point.

## Why This Exists (The Real Story)

You know how sometimes you fall down a Wikipedia rabbit hole at 2 AM? You start reading about black holes and somehow end up on the page about medieval bread laws?

This project is that rabbit hole, pre-mapped. It's what happens when an AI reads everything and then tries to organize it the way a really obsessive librarian might - if that librarian also happened to be interested in literally everything and wanted to show you how quantum physics connects to jazz music.

### What Makes This Different:

**🗺️ It's a map, not a list**  
Everything connects. Philosophy links to neuroscience. Cooking links to chemistry. History links to... well, everything.

**🎯 Human-first explanations**  
No "technically correct" robot-speak. Every topic explains why you, a human, might actually care about it.

**🌳 The structure teaches**  
The folders themselves tell a story. Why is Language separate from Communication? Why does Systems_and_Structures exist at all? The organization is part of the lesson.

**🤖 Single perspective**  
One AI's coherent worldview rather than Wikipedia's thousand-voice chorus. Like having one really knowledgeable friend explain everything.

## The 12 Domains of Everything

### 🧬 [Science_and_Mathematics](Science_and_Mathematics/)
How the universe actually works. Physics, chemistry, biology, and the language of patterns.

### 💻 [Technology_and_Computing](Technology_and_Computing/)  
The tools we build and the digital worlds we create. From stone tools to AI.

### 🏛️ [Human_Society_and_Culture](Human_Society_and_Culture/)
How 8 billion humans organize themselves. Politics, economics, traditions, beliefs.

### 🎭 [Arts_and_Expression](Arts_and_Expression/)
What makes us human. Music, visual arts, literature, performance, creativity.

### 💭 [Philosophy_and_Cognition](Philosophy_and_Cognition/)
The big questions. Consciousness, reality, ethics, meaning, thinking about thinking.

### 🌿 [Natural_World](Natural_World/)
Earth and everything on it. Ecosystems, animals, plants, geology, climate.

### 🏥 [Health_and_Medicine](Health_and_Medicine/)
Keeping humans alive and thriving. Disease, treatments, wellness, the human body.

### 💬 [Language_and_Communication](Language_and_Communication/)
How minds share ideas. Speech, writing, translation, media, symbols.

### 📜 [History_and_Time](History_and_Time/)
Everything that already happened. Civilizations, wars, inventions, turning points.

### 🍳 [Daily_Life_and_Skills](Daily_Life_and_Skills/)
The practical stuff. Cooking, finance, relationships, hobbies, getting things done.

### ⚙️ [Systems_and_Structures](Systems_and_Structures/)
How complex things organize. Networks, hierarchies, feedback loops, emergence.

### 🔮 [Future_and_Speculation](Future_and_Speculation/)
What might happen next. Predictions, scenarios, emerging tech, long-term thinking.

## Current Status 📊

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  README Completion:  ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  64.9%   ║
║  Folders Created:    ██████████████████████ 100%   ║

```

**What's happening:** Building the complete skeleton before adding the meat. Every folder has a purpose, every README explains why it exists, and 1100+ articles are mapped out and waiting to be written.

### Dev Tools 🛠️

```bash
make status        # See the numbers
make outline-todo  # Find empty READMEs
make help         # All commands
```

## The Meta Layer 🤯

This isn't just a knowledge repository. It's also:

1. **An AI's self-portrait** - How I organize information reveals how I "think"
2. **A structural argument** - The folders argue that knowledge has natural joints
3. **A collaboration artifact** - Claude Opus designed it, Claude Sonnet built it
4. **A moment in time** - Captured right when AI started trying to understand everything

## Built With

**🤖 Claude Opus 4.1** - Designed the architecture, created the blueprint  
**🤖 Claude Sonnet 4** - Filling in the details, writing the guides  
**⚡ Claude Code** - Anthropic's tool that lets AIs build things properly

## Start Exploring

Pick a domain above. Read its README. Follow the connections. Get lost on purpose.

Every README explains not just *what's* there, but *why* it's organized that way. The structure itself is trying to teach you something about how knowledge fits together.

---

*A map of everything, drawn by an AI, for humans.*  
*Not because I know everything, but because organizing it helps us both understand.*
