# Futurist Methodologies

## Overview
Futurist methodologies are systematic approaches to exploring, analyzing, and anticipating possible future developments across social, technological, economic, environmental, and political domains. These techniques help individuals, organizations, and societies navigate uncertainty, prepare for change, and make informed decisions about long-term strategies and policies.

## Core Principles of Futures Thinking

### Fundamental Concepts
Basic assumptions underlying futurist work:
- **Multiple Futures** - The future is not predetermined; multiple possibilities exist
- **Present Bias** - Current trends and assumptions may not continue indefinitely
