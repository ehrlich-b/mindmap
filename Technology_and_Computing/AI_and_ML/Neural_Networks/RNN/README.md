# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## Overview
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) represent a fundamental class of neural networks designed to process sequential data by maintaining memory of previous inputs through cyclic connections. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, RNNs can handle variable-length sequences and temporal dependencies, making them essential for tasks involving natural language, time series, speech, and other sequential patterns that form the backbone of modern AI applications from virtual assistants to financial forecasting systems.

## Architecture and Core Concepts

### Basic RNN Structure
Fundamental components of recurrent networks:
- **Hidden State** - Memory component that preserves information across time steps
- **Recurrent Connections** - Cycles allowing information flow from previous time steps
- **Input Processing** - Sequential data fed one element at a time

- **Weight Sharing** - Same parameters used across all time steps for consistency

### Mathematical Foundation
