# Neural Networks

## Overview
Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural systems in the brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections and activation functions. These systems learn patterns from data by adjusting connection strengths during training, enabling them to perform tasks like image recognition, language translation, and decision-making. Neural networks form the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, powering everything from voice assistants to autonomous vehicles.

## Why This Category Exists
Neural networks represent the core technology behind artificial intelligence's recent breakthroughs, distinguishing AI from traditional programming by enabling machines to learn patterns from data rather than following explicit rules. Unlike conventional algorithms that process information step-by-step, neural networks process information in parallel layers, allowing them to handle complex, high-dimensional data like images, speech, and text. Understanding neural networks is essential for comprehending how modern AI systems work and their potential applications across virtually every field.
