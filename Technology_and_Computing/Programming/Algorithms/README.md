# Algorithms

## Overview
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems—the recipes that computers follow to transform inputs into desired outputs. They represent the logical heart of all computation, providing systematic methods for sorting data, searching information, optimizing resources, and making decisions. From the simple process of adding numbers to the complex operations powering search engines and artificial intelligence, algorithms define what computers can accomplish and how efficiently they can do it.

## Why This Category Exists
Algorithms are the bridge between human problem-solving intuition and machine execution. They transform vague notions like "find the best route" or "sort this data" into precise, unambiguous instructions that computers can follow reliably. Understanding algorithms means understanding the fundamental patterns of computational thinking—how to break complex problems into manageable steps, analyze efficiency trade-offs, and design elegant solutions that scale from small examples to massive datasets.
