# Testing

## Overview
Testing represents the systematic evaluation of software systems to identify defects, verify functionality, and ensure quality before deployment to production environments. This discipline encompasses a range of methodologies, tools, and practices designed to validate that software behaves as expected under various conditions while meeting specified requirements. Testing serves as a critical quality gate in the software development lifecycle, providing confidence in system reliability while reducing the risk of costly failures in production environments.

## Why This Category Exists
